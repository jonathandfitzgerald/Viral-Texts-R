i' Oh! the mow, the beautiful snow,
Filling the aky and earth below;
Over the housetops, over the street.
Over the heads otthe people you meet,
Dancing,
Flirting,.
t Skimming along;
Beautiful snow! it can do no wrong.
Flying to kiss a fair lady's cheek,
Clinging to lips in a frolicksome freak,
Beautiful snow from the heaven above.
I Pure as an angel, gentle as love !
Oh ! the snow, the beautiful snow,
How the flakes gather and laugh as they go!
Whirling about in its maddening fun,
It plays in its glee with every one,
Chasing,
Laughing,
a Hurrying by,
It lights on the face, and it sparkles the eye !
And even the dogs, with a bark and a bound,
; Snap at the crystals that eddy around ;
The town is alive, and its heart in a glow,
To welcome the coming of beautiful snow !
How wild the crowd goes swaving along.
Hailing each other with huuior and song!
How the gay sledges, like meteors, flash by,
Bright for the moment, then lost to the eye ;
Ringing, Swinging,
* Dashing they go
Over the orn^t of the beautilul mow :

IE? Suow so pure when it falls from the sky,
'i To be trampled in mud by the crowd rushing by,
r To be trampled and tracked by the thousands of
P Till it blends with the filth in the horrible street!
| Once I was pure as4.he snow?but I fell!
% Fell like the snow-flakes, from Heaven to hell ;
| Fell to be trampled as filth of the street;
P Fell to be scoffed, to be spit 011 and beat,
i; Pleading,
I Cursing,
I Dreading to die,

Through struggle and suffering, at the cost of
multiform agonies, bereavements, devastations,
the American Idea embodied in the preamble
to oar fathers' Declaration of Independence
approaches its complete realization. The no- j
ble, inspiring assertion that u all men are created
equal,"" and endowed by their Creator with
1 a I - I . - ?-e -

uiaiienaDte rigma to nie, liberty. and the pursuit
of happiness, is no longer a glittering generality.
a poet's fancy, a philosopher's speculation,
but the recognized base ot our political
fabric. The benign Revolution, which dates
from the Boston Massacre of 1770, hnds its
logical completion, just one century later, in
the XYth Amendment, which gives to the equal
political and civil rights of every man born or
naturalized in our Republic the shield and defense
of the Federal Constitution. The billows
of Ca>te and Privilege may roar and rage around
that rook, and may transiently seem on the
point of washing it away; but its foundations
are deep-laid ana steadfast, and the breakers of
Reaetion and Slavery are hurled against and
dash their spray over it in vain.
We do not underrate the forces of Prejudice
and Aristocracy. We do not forget that a very
large minority of the American People still
hold in their inmost hearts that Blacks nave no
rights which Whites are bound to respect. We
fully appreciate the desperation wherewith all
the warring elements of hatred to Republican
achievement will he combined and hurlea against
the battlements of Republican ascendency in
the Presidential Election of lt&lt;72. We do not
doubt that local successess, facilitated by Republican
feuds and dissensions, will inspire the
charging host with a saneuine hope of victory,
such as nerved it to put forth its tit most strength
in the earlier stages of the contests of 1864 and
1868. Yet our faith is clear and strong that the
American People still bless God that, on the
red battle fields of our late Civil War, the Union
was upheld and Slavery destroyed, and will
never consciously decide that the precious blood
thereon poured out was lavished in vain.
Th* Tut bi ke believes in the prosecution of
the great struggle by legitimate means to bene6oent
ends. To State Sovereignty it opposes
indissoluble National Integrity; to Slavery for
Blacks, Liberty for All; to Proscription, Enfranchisement;
to Popular Ignorance, Universal
Education; to intensity and eternity of
wrathful Hate, universal and invincible Good
Will. It would fain do its utmost to hasten the
glad day when the South shall vie with the
Aorth iu exultation and gratitude over the disr

appearance 01 me iasi iru^e ur u&amp;uu ui umi
spirit which impelled Man to exult in the ownersnip
and chattelhood of his fellow Man.
Profoundly do we realize that the contest is
not yet ended?that Millions mourn, more or
less publicly, the downfall of the slaveholders'
Confederacy, and rear their children to hate
those by whose valor and constancy its overthrow
was achieved. If we ever geem to differ
essentially from other Republicans, our conviction
that magnanimity is never weakness, that
vengeance is never politic, and that devils are
not cut out by Beelzebub, must serve to explain
alleged eccentricities whose perfect vindication
we leave to Time and Reflection.
The Tkiicng has been, is, and must be, a
zealous advocate of Protection to Uouie Industry.
Regarding habitual idleness as the
greatest foe to hunl&amp;n progress, the bane of human
happiness, we sees to win onr countrymen
in masses from the ensnaring lures of Speculation,
of Traffic, and of always over-crowded Professions,
to the tranquil oaths of Prodnctive
Industry. We would gladly deplete our overcrowded
cities, where thousanas vainly jostle
and crowd in misguided quest of 44 Something
to Do,"" to cover prairies and plains with colonies
absorbed in Agriculture, Mechanics aud
Manufactures, and constantly projecting into
the blank, void wilderness the homes aud the
works of civilized Man. Holding the Protection
of Home Industry by discriminating duties on
imported Wares and Fabrics essential to the
rapid, beneficent diffusion of Production in ali

of our people in all the gainful arts of

and uphold that policy, in undouhling faith
that the true interest, not of a class or a section,
but of each section and every useful class, is
thereby subserved and promoted.
The Tribiue amis to be pre eminently a
News-paper. Its correspondents traverse every
State, are present on every important battle field,
are early advised of every notable Cabinet deoi
ston, observe the proceedings of Congress, Legislatures,
and of Conventions, and report to us by
telegraph all that seems of general interest. We
have paid for one day's momentous advices from
Europe by Cable tar more than our entire receipts
for the issue in which those advices
reached our readers. If lavish outlay, unsleeping
vigilance, and utibonuded faith in the liberality
and discernment of the reading public, will
enable us to make u journal which has no superior
in the accuracy, variety, and freshness of
its contents, The Tkihi n* shall be such a jour
uul.
To Agriculture and the subservient arts, we
have devoted, and shall persistently devote, more
means and space than any of our rivals. We aim
to make Tun Weekly Tribcse such a paper as
no farmer can afford to do without, however
widely his politics may differ from ours. Our reports
of the Cattle, Horse, Produce, and General
Markets, are so full and accurate, our essays in
elucidation of the farmer's calling, and our regular
reports of the Farmers' Club and kindred
gatherings, are so interesting, that the poorest
farmer will lind therein a mine of suggestion and
counsel, of which he cannot remain ignorant
without positive and serious loss. We sell The :

The Ohio Republican Platform.
The following is the full text of the resolution!""
adopted by the Ohio Su e Republican
Convention :
Resolved. By the Republicans of Ohio in
convention assembled, as follows :
1. The Republican party of the luitrd states
may well challenge the admiration and confidence
of the country for its patriotism, courage,
and wisdom in preserving the Uuion of the
States, fur its justice, firmness, and magnanimity
in establishing tor all the people liberty
end equality before the law, for its gratitude to
and provision for the national defenders and
pensioners, for honor and good faith toward
'.he national creditors, and generally for the
luccessfal administration of public affairs in
jeace as well as in war.
2. We not only recognize the 13th, 14th, and
loth amendments to the Constitution 6f the I
Toiled States as accomplished facts, but also !
is just, wise, and valid articles of organic law,
o be jealously defended and enforced as parts
>f ihv Constitution n??w, henceforth, and for
ver.
_3. As it will be necessary atid de3iraf>le to

btaiu from duties on imports a large portion 1
f the revenues needed to defray the expenses
f the Government, to pay the interest on the
alional debt and the principle as it matures,
ach duties should be so adjusted as not to
rejudice hut promote the interests of every
?ction and brunch of industry, ns fur as may
e possible.
4. The present Administration of the Nation- i
I Government has vindicated its right to the
jntiuued confidence of the people. Its success
as been illustrated in the impartial execution
f the law. in its faithfulness, honesty, and
jononiy mtho collection of the public reveues,
and in the expenses of the Government,
) that, while taxation has been reduced to the (
itent of $100,(NJO,000 per year, the national
?bt has been paid to the amount of over $230,X),(X)0,
a reduction unparalleled in history,
he Administration has been equally success
il in the management of our foreign relations,
id has achieved imperishable honor in the ,
ttlement of our differences with Great Britaiu ,
&amp;on terms creditable to both countries as em- ,
>died iu the Treaty of Washington. The ,
tad of the Administration thus distinguished ,
; success uud statesmanship is justly entitled ,
be regarded as a wise and careful civil mag- [
trate. aud bis uniform deference to public ,
ntimcnt shows him to be one whom the ,
mntry can trust, having fully redeemed the j
edge he made before enteriug upon the duties

Chief Magistrate that he would have no a
ilicy of his owd to enforce against the will of ,
e people. r
5. We repeat our comieumation of the policy c
granting subsidies of public lands to corpora- t
?ns and monopolies, and having originated the
licy of granting homesteads to actual settlers,
) declare that the public dotnuiu should be
pt for our laboring population.
6. We are in favor of the adoption of u
orough system of civil service reform, and we
dorse heartily the action of President Grant
settling commissioners under the action of
8 recent so called civil service act.
7. We unite with our fellow citizens in every
rtion of the Union in the hope that the en- Q
ties and resentments of the war may soon be [
ded, and that the day may soon come when,
every State, every citizen may be safe in life, p
rson, property, and civil rights, and may ^
ve the equal protection of the laws, so that
man that was loyal to the Uuion during the p
8at struggle may for that reason be the vica
of persecution, outrage, and assassination,
d so ihat some encouragement may be offered
the removal in proper cases of political dis- (.
ilities for participation in the rebellion.
3. We recommend the calling of a convention
amend the Constitution of the State. 0
3. We express our unqualified approval of
; administration of our present State execu- p
e, Gov. R. B. Hayes, and assure him that
r verdict is "" Well done, good and faithful p
TMt."" q

fold nature- that of an Advocate and an Educator
A? an Advocate, it will assert and maintain ever? 4
right pertaining to the American citizen, independent
of race, color, or accident of birth h
will demand the recognition of these right*
wherever the Constitution extends or the
tional ensign waves- As an Educator, its column
will be an especial medium tor the effective
diffusion of right principles and much needed in
struction, and for the iuculcation of those habits ot
I industry, economy, and self reliance which con
duce to independent manhood, and give vitality
and energy to free government, insuring in return
I j
1 blessings to the governed.
While the editors of the New National Era are
colored men, and the contributors will be mainly
colored, yet the columns will be open tor the ^
I discussion of all questions of vital importance to
I the country by any of its citizens. Comrauuica
tions suitable for publication in these column*,
are solicited from our friends iu all parts ot the
' country, especially in the Southern States.
THE POLITICAL DEPARTMENT.
Upon all questions involving the especial inter
ests of the colored American citizen, the simple
rule of equal justice for all men will govern the
policy of the New National Era. It willdgumud
the recognition of no right for one citizen which
! it will not freely accord to every other. It will
I oppose any attempt to confer privileges upon a
' class, that are withheld from the humblest citizsa
1.

in tne land. It will demand for every citizen
equality before the law, aud full protection o!
person and property iu every State aud Territory
of the National Uuion.
The Nkw National Era will take high ground
upon all public questions, and labor to inspirt
a oneness 01 purpose and encourage unity ot a
action, especially among the newly enfranchised
people of the Reconstructed States. Keniem
bering the past history of the Republican party,
and recognizing what it has done for the colored
people of the nation, the New National Eiu
will give its hearty support to that party without ""1
reserve. This pledge of bdelity to the Republican
party is given under the conviction, and
with the assurance, that iu the tutcye, as in the
past, that party will be the steadfast and indexible
support of those principles of justice and
liberty which have now become a part of the
organic law of the land.
THE EDUCATIONAL DEPARTMENT.
By education the people of a free Government,
such as ours ia intended to be, are better qualitied
to discharge their duties to the State,
and to one another. The nation will ever find
its surest safeguard iu the intelligence of its
voting masses, and the journal which would pro
mote the highest good of government and people
must lend its energies and its power to the aork
of educating that people. Especially is the
agency of the press needed by that portion of
the people, colored and white, who, either
in slavery or under the ban of its blighting intluences,
have been deprived of the opportunities
enjoyed by their more favored brethren of tha

free States.
The Freedmeu's Bureau had under its cbarg#
during the past year, as shown by the last animal
report, 114,623 colored pupils in the day school#
and 89,731 in the Sunday schools, employing
6,660 teachers. About 190,000 of these pupils
were slaves at the commencement of the war.
The educational department of this paper will
contain matter prepared and selected with apeI
cial reference to the capacities and needs of tb.?
large number of pupils and teachers, thereby
making the Naw National Eka a valuable ant
iliary in the scheme of education.
THE INDUSTRIAL DEPARTMENT.
The industrial interests of the colored jieopfe
will claim and receive a large share of our attention.
We adopt the following extracts troiu
the address promulgated by the Colored Labor
! Convention held iu this city in December last, a?

i indicating the view* aud policy of tho Naw N'j
tional Era on this subject:
""For our own good and the welfare of out
| country in all things pertaining to her material

spirit which in its proscriptive regulations deines
us industrial opportunity and the fruits of honest
toil, we rejoice in all those evidences ot proi
pective good which we and other laboring classes
see in the erection of factories and foundries in I
Maryland, Virginia, Kentucky, Missouri, f
ucssee, Georgia, and Alabama, promising thai
our strong and labor hardeued hamls, our intellectual
powers, quickened by the influences ot
education, and our purposes made doubly earnest
by considerate treatment aud the prospect of
just compensation, shall all be giveu to the dt
velopment of the industrial resources ol
several States in the interest of our employers.

Whereas the peculiar condition of the colored

Resolved, That we, the members of the Georgia
State Convention now assembled, do authorize
the President of this Convention to issue a
call, iu the name of the *aid Convention, for a
Southern States Convention, to be held at such
tune and place as he and those with whom he
may advise shall determine best adapted to the
public convenience.
The above is a true extract from the minutes
of the Georgia State Convention.

the distinguished gentlemen whoso names are
subjoined, we do hereby call the ahove-naiued
Convention to meet iu the city of Columbia,
South Cerolira, on tbs 18th day of October,
1871, at 12 o'clock Meridian.

which eelcted delegates may meet and

espective States shall otherwise provide by

Those who uiay be accredited as delegates,
iiould meet the convention prepared to remain

THE EDUCATIONAL DEPARTMENT.
By education the people of a free Government,
such as ours ia intended to be, are better qualitied
to discharge their duties to the State,
and to one another. The nation will ever find
its surest safeguard iu the intelligence of its
voting masses, and the journal which would pro
mote the highest good of government and people
must lend its energies and its power to the aork
of educating that people. Especially is the
agency of the press needed by that portion of
the people, colored and white, who, either

Branch takes its name from a brook, a branch '
?f the Shrewsbury river. In the year 1734 the
place was inhabited dv Indians, and was atvled

Land's End. About that time four men, named ,
respectively Slocum, Parker, Wardell, and Hew- f
ett, came from Rhode Island and established a
lettlemsnt there. A considerable portion of
,he land which they obtained continued in pos- j .
tension of the Slocums until thirty years a-o, J,1

tardy settlers from neighboring provinces 111
jought land in Long Branch at twenty shillings ?""
in acre, built dwellings, and occupied themtelves
with farming and fishing. It now em P
traces a population of 4,500. The Liberty J
Pole is the name given to the village, from a
iagstaff erected during the war of 1812, while
die coast portion, upon which the cottages and ^
lotela are situated, is known as the Shore,
fronting the ooean. Land purchased at the ei
dge of the village by Mr. Samuel Laird, in ,
1863, for $2.50 an acre, was sold for $4,000 in .

together one nite at Bascom's. That 1 mite
get em all at ooe time, I waited till the regler
evenin for the raid on the niggers and Northern
settlers up toards Garrettstown, knowin that
on their return they'd all stop at Bascom's for
a drink, and that ef they'd bin successful in
their hangin and burnin they'd be in good
humor and ready to adopt anything I shood
suggest. It vruz a very short but a very satisfactry
oonsultashen. There wuz some objiekshuns
on the part uv a few to wat tbey called
an abandonment uv Dimoeratic idees, but Bas
com settled their hash in very short metre.
He remarkt that it wuz necessary that the
offises be in the hands uv his friends for obvius
reasons. He wantid pay and he knowed uv
no uthor way to git it. He beleeved in the
fullest freedom uv thought and ackshen, and
that every one shood express hisself untrarameled,
but he coodent abide a idiot. If there
wuz any one in that assemblage so stoopid ez
to differ with him on that question, let him
make hisself known. No sick man shood ever
git a drop at his bar, never; sich a one wuz
not deservin uv even the commonest nesesaries
uv life. Several who had riz to their feet to

object dropt ez though they hed bio shot.
It wuz determined to bold a public meetin
the next nite at the church to make a public
endorsement uv Yallandygum's idees.
Ez the prinsipal objict uv the meetin wuz to
convins the Republikios uv the doubtful States
that the Diinocrisy uv the South really accepted
the situashun, and meat, in ded ernest, to recognise
the great priosiple uv equality, I arranged
to hev all the niggers u v the Corners present,
and saved for thcra the best seats in the house.
Joe Biglor and Pollock cum uv course, wich I
ooodont help.
I opened the exercises by making a short
speech ez I took the chair. I rejoist thet the
time hed finally arriv when the lion and the
lamb hed laid down together, and a small child
wuz leading uv em. 1 knowed thet our colored
fellow-citizens hed been dispitefully yooaed,
and thet doo respeck hed not been alluz paid
to our fellow-citizens uv the North, but that
time hed now passed, and I hoped forever. The
Dimucrisy uv the North, Vrallandygum, hed
spoke they hed accepted the situashun, halleloogy,
and from this time henceforth and forever
there wuz to be notbin but peece. i then
offered the follerm resoloosheu :
""Resolved, That the Diinocrisy uv the Yoouited
States recognize the legality uv all the
amendments made to the Constituoshen dooring
and since the late onpleaBantnis, and that they
recognise aud most heartily acquiesce in all the
results uv the war ; that they not ouly withdraw
all their opposisben to yooniversal suffrage,
but pledge theirselves to see that our
Afrikin fellow-citizens hev not only this but
all other rites heretofore enjoyed excloosively
by the Caucashen.""
I put the question ez to the adopshen uv the
reaolooshen, aud it wuz carried yoonanimusly.
It wood hev bin well hed I stopped here, but I
didn't. My prevalin weekuess is to slop over,
and I slopt on this okkasion fearfully. I called
upon the citizens uv the Corners to prove their
faith by their works. ""There are,"" 1 said, in
a spasm of delite, ""present at this meetin
twenty two uv our fellow-citizens uv Afrikin
descent. Let em step forrerd on this platform

It wuz done. The twenty-two uiggers stepped
forrerd, the whites designated advanced,
the two lines grasped each other by the hand,
and I wuz about to wave, when Joe Bigler rize.
Ho begged me to wait a minnit till he hed made
hia remark. The site afore him moved him almost
to tears. Ef he had ever harbored a suspishen
that there wuzu't anything generous in
the Kentucky breast he took it all back. The
acshun uv to-night wuz not only just but it wuz
generons.
""Generous!"" sed I, ""why generous?""
""Becoz,"" said he, ""the niggers wood be in a

Every year I endeavor to make some improvement
in my method of house-cleaning.
This spring I made up my mind to adhere no
longer to the poky old plan of grandmother?
which was to begin at the attic, and wind up
in the cellar?but determined to strike out in
another direction : and so, while the subject
was rife in my mind, I set about executing my
new projects at once, although it was but the
first of April, and the weather quite chilly and
raw. In the first place, I had every stove
1. moved out, then every carpet taken up, all the
pictures taken from the walls, the curtaius
taken down, everything piled out on the buck

if; porch, and the earjtetless halls tilled to overflowing
with chairs, statues, leather dusters,
[N vases, hair muttrasses, parian brackets, and
jjf pillows ; and while everything was in the wildji

the floor, and down stairs into the kitchen.

""Where's Ted?"" he inquired, pausing for

breath between the vigorous puffs at the tire.
""I haven't seen hiui all the afternoon. I
sent him out to play and he hasn't been in the
house since,"" I replied.
Frank dropped the shavings and started out
in search of hi in.
1 waited arid waited, and shivered with the
cold, but no Frunk came. I sat in the stiff
backed chair arid closed my eyes. The last
I thing I remembered was a violent nod which
nearly dislocated my neck.
"" Hattie!""
1 awoke with a start. Frank was shaking
me.
"" You will take your death of cold ; you have
been fast asleep.""
""Where was Ted ? Did you find him in the
cistern?"" 1 asked, dreamily.
""No,"" laughed Frank, "" but just about as
bad; the poor fellow was in the coal cellar,
asleep like his mother.""
I rubbed my eyes and looked at the child;
he was covered with coal dust from his head to
his feet, and as black as any negro. Frank
prepared supper while I washed Ted's face aud
hands. .
"" llow can you finish your cleaning without
Norah?"" he inquired.
"" I am sure I don't see how 1 can,"" I replied,
as the mountains of work arose in my troubled
tnind. ""Norah must be sent away in the
morning.""
We all ate heartily of our BUpper, notwithstanding
the eggs were fried until they were so
Crist) aud brittle that they broke into bits if you
so much as looked at them, and the toast was
burnt, and the coffee not half boiled ; still, as I
was so hungry, it all tasted pretty good. After

we bad cleaned away the table and piled the
dishes away to be washed in the morning, we
retired, and being so fatigued I did not awaken
until a late hour in the morning.
Norah was dismissed. Frank went to his
office and 1 to tny cleaning. Frank had the
carpet shaken, and the parlor floor being dry,
I soon had it all tacked down ; then moved the
chairs ili, and began to dust the mantel ornaments,
but, O horror ! I let fall one of my
loveliest vases and shivered it into a thousand
fragments. A very bad beginniug of the day,
I thought, sorrowfully picking up the pieces.
44 Mamma,"" cried a shrill voice, "" I's all
jess up.""
44 W here are you, Ted I called.
44 Here,"" cried Ted.
44 And where is 4here;' you're in some mischief,
I'll be bound.""
1 heard Ted's chuckling laugh, and a great
scrambling up the attic stairs.
After 1 had throwu the shattered pieces ol
my vase away, I ran up stairs to see what ht
was doing. What a sight met my eyes ! Ted
was arrayed iu my violet silk, pinned up it
front, and trailing far behind on the floor, my
white lace shawl around his shoulders, and my
best bonnet on his head.
I stood transfixed for a moment, while Ted
went prancing round und round iu the dust and

clothes. My dress was a mass of grease, cob
webs and dust , the front width was wretchedly
torn with the puis; my shawl and bonnet was
crushed and torn. 1 put them all away with ?
sigh of regret, and turned my attention once
more to the perpetrator of this terrible deed
Just then some one knocked at the back door
On opening it 1 found a stout German girl on
the step who talked so broken that I coulc
scarcely understand her, but managed to com
prehend enough to know that Frank hud en
gaged her for me. 1 set her to work iinmedi
ately to clean the china closet, and returned tc
uiy wounded Ted. Suddenly 1 heard a terrible
crash in the dining-room. ""Ileavensl"" I ex
claimed ; ""what can have happoued now ?"" and
rushing out I found the frightened girl clasping
and unclasping her hands in a heartrending
mariner. No wonder. She had upset the table
on which all my shining glass and chiuu wan
placed. Everything was literally smashed to
fiieces. My beautiful celery glasses! My gobets,
and tea-set! My fruit stands ! Was there
ever such a poor afflicted mortal as 1 'i Wordu
failed me to express my feelings at that momeut.
1 sat down perfectly stunned, to witnese
the harrowiug sight of all uiy superb dishes
swept away.
There came another knock at the door. This
time an Irish girl made her appearance. I
i wondered if Frank intended to send a regiment
! to destroy my house. However, J took her in,

and the nrst thing 1 told her to do was to answer
the door bell wliich bad rung twice. I
peeped through the door, which was partly
open, and saw two ladies, but could uot distinguish
who tbey were.
44 Mum, there are two wimmen as wants to
see yez,"" said Anu, giving the door u violent
push against my head.
4*Go tell them to excuse me,"" I said ; and
beiDg very dizzy from the blow, I failed to
notice that Ann, in her stupidity, had left the
sitting-rooiu door wide open, aud as the ladies
came out of the parlor they saw me plainly.
41 O mortification !"" I was all rags and dirt,
but had become somewhat reconciled to any
misfortunes by this time.
When Frank came up to supper, the hall
was very dark ; Ann was putting down the door
mat. Frank forgot all about the new servant,
and in the darkness mistook the horid Irish
girl for me, and kissed her. Ann screamed
and rau, and fell over a chair; Frank tore
j round and swore : and said he would rather
I be in Bedlam than where a woman was cleaning
house ; wondered why I couldn't have the hall
lighted. To all this I made no reply, but
smiled grimly. Being so overwhelmed with
; my own griefs, 1 did not care if Frank kissed
! every servant girl in the United States.
The next morning the German girl left.

my frown again. Ann remained, and we proceeded
to finish our havoc. The day was gloriously

The tirst operations were commenced on the
vestern wall, at a point near what is known as
Wilson's Arch. It receives tho name from the
act that it was tirst discovered by Captain
Wilson, who had not the means, however, to
prosecute any mining operations. Captain
Warren's explorations proved this arch to be
>ne of a series forming a viaduct which led j
'rem the Temple toward the palace of Herod
>n the western hillt and constituting perhaps
he very bridge across which Jesus was conluctcd
from Pilate to Ilerod on the day of his

iroken and buried the aqueduct in its fall; and

Every year I endeavor to make some improvement
in my method of house-cleaning.
This spring I made up my mind to adhere no
longer to the poky old plan of grandmother?
which was to begin at the attic, and wind up
in the cellar?but determined to strike out in
another direction : and so, while the subject

When I had occasion to go through the hall
again, I paused aud listened ; 1 could hear

II mounted the stairs. There, in the middle ot
the room, she sat iu a rocking chair, a bucket
of water sood before her, while she swayed
lazily back and forth with the mop in her hand,
which left a long trail of dirty water behind it.
'Norah,"" 1 cried, ""didn't i tell you to uiop

""Faith, mum, an l'in doiu' it a? last as 1
can,' ahe replied.
""How can you uiop sifting Joan ?"" 1 asked, &lt;
indignantly.
""Get right out of that chair,"" 1 said.
Norah slowly arose and staggered against
the wall.
Hie, mum, hie, yez see I se awake.""
""You're drank, you had better say,"" 1 re plied.

""Leave the room and go to bed,"" 1 said iu- j
dignautly ; ""to morrow 1 shall dismiss you.""
After much arguing, Norah finally decided
to retire, and 1 was left sole monarch of all the !

but the work had to be done, and 1 seized the

"" Why, Hattie ! Hattie ! what arc you cry-1

ing about? I'll make the fire; never mind!
about the sapper ; had a capital dioner down
town ; come down stairs out of this damp
room.""
And Frank, who always got good and sorry
the moment after he was cross, helped me off
the floor, and down stairs into the kitchen.
* Now don't cry any more,"" he said, wiping
my tear-bedewed cheek with his handkerchief,
""sit down, and I'll have a tire in two
minutes.""
""Where's Ted?"" he inquired, pausing for

breath between the vigorous puffs at the tire.
""I haven't seen hiui all the afternoon. I
sent him out to play and he hasn't been in the
house since,"" I replied.
Frank dropped the shavings and started out
in search of hi in.
1 waited arid waited, and shivered with the
cold, but no Frunk came. I sat in the stiff
backed chair arid closed my eyes. The last
I thing I remembered was a violent nod which
nearly dislocated my neck.
"" Hattie!""
1 awoke with a start. Frank was shaking
me.
"" You will take your death of cold ; you have
been fast asleep.""
""Where was Ted ? Did you find him in the
cistern?"" 1 asked, dreamily.
""No,"" laughed Frank, "" but just about as
bad; the poor fellow was in the coal cellar,
asleep like his mother.""
I rubbed my eyes and looked at the child;
he was covered with coal dust from his head to
his feet, and as black as any negro. Frank
prepared supper while I washed Ted's face aud
hands. .
"" llow can you finish your cleaning without
Norah?"" he inquired.
"" I am sure I don't see how 1 can,"" I replied,
as the mountains of work arose in my troubled
tnind. ""Norah must be sent away in the
morning.""
We all ate heartily of our BUpper, notwithstanding
the eggs were fried until they were so
Crist) aud brittle that they broke into bits if you
so much as looked at them, and the toast was
burnt, and the coffee not half boiled ; still, as I
was so hungry, it all tasted pretty good. After

we bad cleaned away the table and piled the
dishes away to be washed in the morning, we
retired, and being so fatigued I did not awaken
until a late hour in the morning.
Norah was dismissed. Frank went to his
office and 1 to tny cleaning. Frank had the
carpet shaken, and the parlor floor being dry,
I soon had it all tacked down ; then moved the
chairs ili, and began to dust the mantel ornaments,
but, O horror ! I let fall one of my
loveliest vases and shivered it into a thousand
fragments. A very bad beginniug of the day,
I thought, sorrowfully picking up the pieces.
44 Mamma,"" cried a shrill voice, "" I's all
jess up.""
44 W here are you, Ted I called.
44 Here,"" cried Ted.
44 And where is 4here;' you're in some mischief,
I'll be bound.""
1 heard Ted's chuckling laugh, and a great
scrambling up the attic stairs.
After 1 had throwu the shattered pieces ol
my vase away, I ran up stairs to see what ht
was doing. What a sight met my eyes ! Ted
was arrayed iu my violet silk, pinned up it
front, and trailing far behind on the floor, my
white lace shawl around his shoulders, and my
best bonnet on his head.
I stood transfixed for a moment, while Ted
went prancing round und round iu the dust and
dirt of the attic ; then 1 started after him. Ol
course be ran, screaming and laughing. 4,Tak&lt;

top to the bottom of the stairs.
Kip, rip, weut my violet silk ; bump, bump
went Ted. I flew down after him with my hear
in my mouth, and picked up a little iusensibh
heap of lace, ribbous, silk and dirt. That fal
saved Ted from a good whipping. I carriet

be opened his eyes ; then 1 examined my ruinec
clothes. My dress was a mass of grease, cob
webs and dust , the front width was wretchedly
torn with the puis; my shawl and bonnet was
crushed and torn. 1 put them all away with ?
sigh of regret, and turned my attention once
more to the perpetrator of this terrible deed
Just then some one knocked at the back door
On opening it 1 found a stout German girl on
the step who talked so broken that I coulc
scarcely understand her, but managed to com
prehend enough to know that Frank hud en
gaged her for me. 1 set her to work iinmedi
ately to clean the china closet, and returned tc
uiy wounded Ted. Suddenly 1 heard a terrible
crash in the dining-room. ""Ileavensl"" I ex
claimed ; ""what can have happoued now ?"" and
rushing out I found the frightened girl clasping
and unclasping her hands in a heartrending
mariner. No wonder. She had upset the table
on which all my shining glass and chiuu wan
placed. Everything was literally smashed to
fiieces. My beautiful celery glasses! My gobets,
and tea-set! My fruit stands ! Was there
ever such a poor afflicted mortal as 1 'i Wordu
failed me to express my feelings at that momeut.
1 sat down perfectly stunned, to witnese
the harrowiug sight of all uiy superb dishes
swept away.
There came another knock at the door. This
time an Irish girl made her appearance. I
i wondered if Frank intended to send a regiment
! to destroy my house. However, J took her in,

and the nrst thing 1 told her to do was to answer
the door bell wliich bad rung twice. I
peeped through the door, which was partly
open, and saw two ladies, but could uot distinguish
who tbey were.
44 Mum, there are two wimmen as wants to
see yez,"" said Anu, giving the door u violent
push against my head.
4*Go tell them to excuse me,"" I said ; and
beiDg very dizzy from the blow, I failed to
notice that Ann, in her stupidity, had left the
sitting-rooiu door wide open, aud as the ladies
came out of the parlor they saw me plainly.
41 O mortification !"" I was all rags and dirt,
but had become somewhat reconciled to any
misfortunes by this time.
When Frank came up to supper, the hall
was very dark ; Ann was putting down the door
mat. Frank forgot all about the new servant,
and in the darkness mistook the horid Irish
girl for me, and kissed her. Ann screamed
and rau, and fell over a chair; Frank tore
j round and swore : and said he would rather
I be in Bedlam than where a woman was cleaning
house ; wondered why I couldn't have the hall
lighted. To all this I made no reply, but
smiled grimly. Being so overwhelmed with
; my own griefs, 1 did not care if Frank kissed
! every servant girl in the United States.
The next morning the German girl left.
Probably she was fearful she should encounter
my frown again. Ann remained, and we proceeded
to finish our havoc. The day was gloriously
begun by Ann, who succeeded charui:
iogly iu breaking the glultes of the chandelier,
and upsetting my gold fish on the carpet, to
say nothing of the water. 1 believe 1 shook or
slapped the girl, 1 don't remember which.

sucb a passion that she hacked up against the
window and thrust her clumsy foot through
' my lace curtain. This was the grand finale.
1 hurst into tears and so did Ann. Ted, hearing
the sobs, came running in, and not knowing
what to make of it, joined in the chorus.
Aiuidst one of our longest and loudest wails,
the street door suddenly flew open, and in
walked tuy Aunt Thankful, with several dozen
carpet hags and bundles, prepared evidently
for a long visit.

shrieked, letting all her traps fall. "" What
has happened? Is Frank dead, Ted scalded,
or the house on fire?""
1 made no reply, hut sobbed heedlessly ou.

voice. "" Answer me immediately. What is
the matter ?""
"" My lace curtain,"" I gurgled out.
Aunt Thankful put on her spectacles, sat
down on the iiuor and examined it. "" Silly
puss,"" she mumbled- "" I can darn that iu ten
minutes.''
"" Yes, with blue stocking yarn,"" I said, and
began to laugh sarcastically, and tbeu 1 laughed
aud laughed. Ann laughed, and Ted laughed.
Poor Aunt Thankful stared at us iu horror, and
a**ist

and jumped up off the floor ; ahe seized uiy ariu
aud dragged me into the bed room, and put me
to bed, then went out aud locked the door,
and left me alone, i went to sleep. When I
awoke Auut Thankful was fitting by the bed
dewing.
Aunt Thankful,"" 1 said, ""when did you
come ?""
'Yesterday morning,"" she replied.
44 What time is it now ?"" 1 inquired.
""Three o'clock,"" answered Auut Thankful.
* 1 have slept several hours, then,"" 1 said.
Was 1 asleep when you came?""
""I should rather think not; when I came
you were crazy, and I put you to bed. \rou (

THE 3STE
slept all the rest of the day and night until tb;s
bleosed minute, and if you hadn't been put to
bed you would hare bean put in the insane asylam,
now.""
I began to laugh. Aunt Thankful stared at
me and said :
""If you laugh any more 1 will put you in
the cellar, and feed you on bread and water for j
a week.""
This not being a pleasant prospect, I subsided.
"" You are a precious woman to clean house,""
continued she. "" 1 should have thought a child
would know better than to commence to clean j
right in the middle of the house. You should
| commence in the attic and go down. You don't

meekly.

to freeze. It's a wonder you didn't have the

Thankful.
"" 1 must get up aud clean the attic,"" I said.

I cleaned it myself.""
"" Well, there are the rest of the carpets to |

"" They're all down.""
"" And the pictures t""
"" All hung.""
1 gave a great sigh of relief. What would i
have done if it had uot been lor Aunt Thankful
! She had accomplished in one day what it
would have taken me a week to perform, but
! then I never could bob around like Aunt
Thankful ; she seems to be made of wire. I
have learued since then to take Aunt Thank*
fill's advice, uever to commence cleaning until
the weather is warui, and never to commence
at the wrong end of the house.
It is such a mortification to think that my
new plan was a total failure.?Htarth and

was the tlrat to call upon him in his seclu- j
ive retirement. In reply to a question as to
vbo was his candidate, aud what he proposed
o do, he replied that he had no candidate, and ? 1
hat he didn't propose to do anything. He &lt;
vas very positive, however, that Pendleton !
tad no chance for the nomination ; and this ' 1
act, so far from grieving him, seemed to cheer
liui very much. lie felt bitter toward Pendle- i
on and his friends because they had helped > 1

luiekly resolved to vacate a seat in the Ohio i

Val. accepted with alacrity, pledging himself 1
0 stand by Pendleton while there was a chance i
or hirn, but well knowing there was no chance, i
)u the evening of the first day of the conven- &lt;
ion Valianaigham had a long conference with i
he New York delegation, in which the subject i
if Chase's nomination was agitated at consid-! i
irable length. There was little or no opposi- ! 1
ion to it, and the only question in dispute I
eeuied to be as to the best uieuns of bringing i

ion, and Seymour was to decline in favor of j '
Jhase, who was thereupon to be put through i
vith a hurra. This programme was spoiled by
1 little squabble for personal precedence among i
he Ohio delegates. Mr. George McCook in- , 1
listed upon thrusting himself forward to do all &lt;

Jhio delegation. It was he, we believe, who &lt;
irst suggested Seymour to the convention. ! i

eutly to urge acceptance, but really, as we :
lave reasoD to know, ""to give the old fellow j i

Six Humlrrd Chinamen Koailtd Alive on
Coolie Ship?A Fl*r> PrlMa-ltorjr of *
Survivor.
The Hong-Kong Mail of the 12th May gives
the following particular.- of he burning of a
coolie ship off the coast of China, of which I
*ome mention has already been made in the j i
telegraphic dispatches :
On the 4th instant a ship formerly known as i
the Dolores Ugarte sailed from Macao under ]
the new name of Don Juan, with six hundred
and fifty coolies, for Callao. On the 6th, w hen iiixty
miles to the southward of Hong Kong, a
5re broke out. How the fire was caused is not
ret positively known The fire gained the (
nastery over the ship. While it was doing so (
the hutches were kept battened down upon the
passengers for the space of oue hour. When
the captain and most of the crew had made I
their escape the fastenings of the hatches were t
removed ; fifty or sixty of the "" passengers,'' j s
.vho were nearest to the deck were thereby I
enabled to escape, to hang on to a Hoating i &lt;
mast, and ultimately to be picked up by a fish- i
mg junk and brought on to Hong Kong ; but
ill the rest of the 44 passengers"" remained ou \
board, suffocated and "" stewed in their own |
[at,"" until the ship was totally burned. That |
is the simple statement of an incident which ]
excels in horror anything that has ever before I
occurred in the history of the Macao coolie i
trade.

3D duty night and day. On the third day
after we sailed, shortly ufter our breakfast, \
there was a lire on board. The tire occurred i
in the aft part, in a room adjoiniug our hold, t
The smoke came into our hold in a great vol- i
lime. It had a strong smell of gunpowder. I i
heard no explosion whatever before the alarm j
of tire. There was no foreigner in the hold at (
the time. No foreigner came into our hold t
during the tire. The hatch grating was never
opened all the wnile. The smoke came in
very thick, und a great many were suffocated.
More than one hour after the smoke first came (
Into our hold the hatidi grating was torn off
by somebody, by one of the cooks, I helieve.
We all made a rush for the hatchway. I was ,
partially suffocated when 1 got to the hatchwuy,
aud 1 could not get up it. Some China- (
men pulled me up. The tire had then reached i
the hatchway. My face was severely burned in i
my attempt to get up the hatch. (The whole 1
of the left side of this man's face presents a
mass of roasted flesh, besides several !>urus
about the arms and hands.) When I came up
the whole ship, trom the mainmast to the steru, 1
was a mass of flames. The foremast hud not
caught tire then. About twenty men clung to
the rigging, and there were more than ten
others holding to the bowsprit. I was holding !
to the anchor-chain. The anchor was danglang
at the side of the ship, in the bow. 1
seuted myself on the anchor, and iny hands
were holding to the chain.

into the sea wi:h the unchor. I could swim a
little, and 1 swam to a burned spar which was 1
floating on the water. There were three or ;
four others besides me holding to this spar.
It was a small spar. When 1 fell into the
water it was about one hour after I earne out
of the hold. When I caiae on deck I could
not see any foreigners, uor did I see auy boats.

day the tire occurred. There was no fighting 1
ou board on the day of the fire. Nothing
unusual took place in the hold that day. We
could play at dominoes or dice in the hold. \
My treatment on board the fishing junk was
very good, but I coubl not eat, as uiv pain is .
very grent. I could not tell how the fire origi- &lt;

Six Humlrrd Chinamen Koailtd Alive on
Coolie Ship?A Fl*r> PrlMa-ltorjr of *
Survivor.
The Hong-Kong Mail of the 12th May gives
the following particular.- of he burning of a
coolie ship off the coast of China, of which I
*ome mention has already been made in the j i
telegraphic dispatches :
On the 4th instant a ship formerly known as i
the Dolores Ugarte sailed from Macao under ]
the new name of Don Juan, with six hundred
and fifty coolies, for Callao. On the 6th, w hen iiixty
miles to the southward of Hong Kong, a
5re broke out. How the fire was caused is not
ret positively known The fire gained the (
nastery over the ship. While it was doing so (
the hutches were kept battened down upon the
passengers for the space of oue hour. When
the captain and most of the crew had made I
their escape the fastenings of the hatches were t
removed ; fifty or sixty of the "" passengers,'' j s
.vho were nearest to the deck were thereby I
enabled to escape, to hang on to a Hoating i &lt;
mast, and ultimately to be picked up by a fish- i
mg junk and brought on to Hong Kong ; but
ill the rest of the 44 passengers"" remained ou \
board, suffocated and "" stewed in their own |
[at,"" until the ship was totally burned. That |
is the simple statement of an incident which ]
excels in horror anything that has ever before I
occurred in the history of the Macao coolie i
trade.
Leung Ashew, one of the coolies who was ,

rescued and brought to Hong Kong, gives the ! ,
following narrative : ! .
Nobody was allowed to smoke. We had '
tive lights in the hold all night long. There '
were about ten foreigners ueting as sentries in
the hold. They had 9words and rattans. 1 j
tiave not seen them use the rattans. They were
3D duty night and day. On the third day
after we sailed, shortly ufter our breakfast, \
there was a lire on board. The tire occurred i
in the aft part, in a room adjoiniug our hold, t
The smoke came into our hold in a great vol- i
lime. It had a strong smell of gunpowder. I i
heard no explosion whatever before the alarm j
of tire. There was no foreigner in the hold at (
the time. No foreigner came into our hold t
during the tire. The hatch grating was never
opened all the wnile. The smoke came in
very thick, und a great many were suffocated.
More than one hour after the smoke first came (
Into our hold the hatidi grating was torn off
by somebody, by one of the cooks, I helieve.
We all made a rush for the hatchway. I was ,
partially suffocated when 1 got to the hatchwuy,
aud 1 could not get up it. Some China- (
men pulled me up. The tire had then reached i
the hatchway. My face was severely burned in i
my attempt to get up the hatch. (The whole 1
of the left side of this man's face presents a
mass of roasted flesh, besides several !>urus
about the arms and hands.) When I came up
the whole ship, trom the mainmast to the steru, 1
was a mass of flames. The foremast hud not
caught tire then. About twenty men clung to
the rigging, and there were more than ten
others holding to the bowsprit. I was holding !
to the anchor-chain. The anchor was danglang
at the side of the ship, in the bow. 1
seuted myself on the anchor, and iny hands
were holding to the chain.

the tire. \V hen the fire reached the woodwork
which held the anehor-cnain I was tumbled
into the sea wi:h the unchor. I could swim a
little, and 1 swam to a burned spar which was 1
floating on the water. There were three or ;
four others besides me holding to this spar.
It was a small spar. When 1 fell into the
water it was about one hour after I earne out
of the hold. When I caiae on deck I could
not see any foreigners, uor did I see auy boats.
1 was very much contused, and was partly inseusihle
from the effects of uiy burns. There
was a larger spar floating on the water, and
more than ten men were holding on it. 1 could
not say what had become of the men that clung
on this larger spar. I and the others that held
to the smaller spar were carried away by the I {
current, and it was because of this that 1 did i ,
not see what had become of the larger spar j
and its men. We were carried away much
faster by the current, as we had fewer men and 1
our spar was much smaller. 1 was carried so j |
far away from the burning ship that I could
hardly see her. I was picked up by a fishing '
junk that passed in the evening of the same 1
day the tire occurred. There was no fighting 1
ou board on the day of the fire. Nothing
unusual took place in the hold that day. We
could play at dominoes or dice in the hold. \
My treatment on board the fishing junk was
very good, but I coubl not eat, as uiv pain is .
very grent. I could not tell how the fire origi- &lt;
uuted On our way here on that fishing junk
we saw many persons on the water, but the j
junk people would not receive them, as they
had no money. Before I left the burning
wreck 1 9aw blood ooze out from the sides of

the moment after he was cross, helped me off

my tear-bedewed cheek with his handkerchief,
""sit down, and I'll have a tire in two
minutes.""
""Where's Ted?"" he inquired, pausing for

breath between the vigorous puffs at the tire.
""I haven't seen hiui all the afternoon. I
sent him out to play and he hasn't been in the
house since,"" I replied.
Frank dropped the shavings and started out
in search of hi in.
1 waited arid waited, and shivered with the
cold, but no Frunk came. I sat in the stiff
backed chair arid closed my eyes. The last
I thing I remembered was a violent nod which
nearly dislocated my neck.
"" Hattie!""
1 awoke with a start. Frank was shaking
me.
"" You will take your death of cold ; you have
been fast asleep.""
""Where was Ted ? Did you find him in the
cistern?"" 1 asked, dreamily.
""No,"" laughed Frank, "" but just about as
bad; the poor fellow was in the coal cellar,
asleep like his mother.""
I rubbed my eyes and looked at the child;
he was covered with coal dust from his head to
his feet, and as black as any negro. Frank
prepared supper while I washed Ted's face aud
hands. .
"" llow can you finish your cleaning without
Norah?"" he inquired.
"" I am sure I don't see how 1 can,"" I replied,
as the mountains of work arose in my troubled
tnind. ""Norah must be sent away in the
morning.""
We all ate heartily of our BUpper, notwithstanding
the eggs were fried until they were so
Crist) aud brittle that they broke into bits if you
so much as looked at them, and the toast was
burnt, and the coffee not half boiled ; still, as I
was so hungry, it all tasted pretty good. After

we bad cleaned away the table and piled the
dishes away to be washed in the morning, we
retired, and being so fatigued I did not awaken
until a late hour in the morning.
Norah was dismissed. Frank went to his
office and 1 to tny cleaning. Frank had the
carpet shaken, and the parlor floor being dry,
I soon had it all tacked down ; then moved the
chairs ili, and began to dust the mantel ornaments,
but, O horror ! I let fall one of my
loveliest vases and shivered it into a thousand
fragments. A very bad beginniug of the day,
I thought, sorrowfully picking up the pieces.
44 Mamma,"" cried a shrill voice, "" I's all
jess up.""
44 W here are you, Ted I called.
44 Here,"" cried Ted.
44 And where is 4here;' you're in some mischief,
I'll be bound.""
1 heard Ted's chuckling laugh, and a great
scrambling up the attic stairs.
After 1 had throwu the shattered pieces ol
my vase away, I ran up stairs to see what ht
was doing. What a sight met my eyes ! Ted
was arrayed iu my violet silk, pinned up it
front, and trailing far behind on the floor, my
white lace shawl around his shoulders, and my
best bonnet on his head.
I stood transfixed for a moment, while Ted
went prancing round und round iu the dust and

sigh of regret, and turned my attention once
more to the perpetrator of this terrible deed
Just then some one knocked at the back door
On opening it 1 found a stout German girl on
the step who talked so broken that I coulc
scarcely understand her, but managed to com
prehend enough to know that Frank hud en
gaged her for me. 1 set her to work iinmedi
ately to clean the china closet, and returned tc
uiy wounded Ted. Suddenly 1 heard a terrible
crash in the dining-room. ""Ileavensl"" I ex
claimed ; ""what can have happoued now ?"" and
rushing out I found the frightened girl clasping
and unclasping her hands in a heartrending
mariner. No wonder. She had upset the table
on which all my shining glass and chiuu wan
placed. Everything was literally smashed to
fiieces. My beautiful celery glasses! My gobets,
and tea-set! My fruit stands ! Was there
ever such a poor afflicted mortal as 1 'i Wordu
failed me to express my feelings at that momeut.
1 sat down perfectly stunned, to witnese
the harrowiug sight of all uiy superb dishes
swept away.
There came another knock at the door. This
time an Irish girl made her appearance. I
i wondered if Frank intended to send a regiment
! to destroy my house. However, J took her in,

and the nrst thing 1 told her to do was to answer
the door bell wliich bad rung twice. I
peeped through the door, which was partly
open, and saw two ladies, but could uot distinguish
who tbey were.
44 Mum, there are two wimmen as wants to
see yez,"" said Anu, giving the door u violent
push against my head.
4*Go tell them to excuse me,"" I said ; and
beiDg very dizzy from the blow, I failed to
notice that Ann, in her stupidity, had left the
sitting-rooiu door wide open, aud as the ladies
came out of the parlor they saw me plainly.
41 O mortification !"" I was all rags and dirt,
but had become somewhat reconciled to any
misfortunes by this time.
When Frank came up to supper, the hall
was very dark ; Ann was putting down the door
mat. Frank forgot all about the new servant,
and in the darkness mistook the horid Irish
girl for me, and kissed her. Ann screamed
and rau, and fell over a chair; Frank tore
j round and swore : and said he would rather
I be in Bedlam than where a woman was cleaning
house ; wondered why I couldn't have the hall
lighted. To all this I made no reply, but
smiled grimly. Being so overwhelmed with
; my own griefs, 1 did not care if Frank kissed
! every servant girl in the United States.
The next morning the German girl left.
Probably she was fearful she should encounter
my frown again. Ann remained, and we proceeded
to finish our havoc. The day was gloriously
begun by Ann, who succeeded charui:

what to make of it, joined in the chorus.
Aiuidst one of our longest and loudest wails,
the street door suddenly flew open, and in
walked tuy Aunt Thankful, with several dozen

began to laugh sarcastically, and tbeu 1 laughed

""Three o'clock,"" answered Auut Thankful.

""I should rather think not; when I came

I began to laugh. Aunt Thankful stared at
me and said :
""If you laugh any more 1 will put you in
the cellar, and feed you on bread and water for j
a week.""
This not being a pleasant prospect, I subsided.
"" You are a precious woman to clean house,""
continued she. "" 1 should have thought a child
would know better than to commence to clean j
right in the middle of the house. You should

"" 1 must get up aud clean the attic,"" I said.

I cleaned it myself.""
"" Well, there are the rest of the carpets to |

"" They're all down.""

1 gave a great sigh of relief. What would i
have done if it had uot been lor Aunt Thankful
! She had accomplished in one day what it
would have taken me a week to perform, but

Thankful ; she seems to be made of wire. I

n the solid rock beneath this bridge, were also !
li8oovered. Part of this bridge has fallen, and
iroken and buried the aqueduct in its fall; and
;he original pavement of the ancient road in
:he valley itself is forty-five feet below the pres
;nt surface formed by the ruins of the ancieut
ivalls and bouses. Nor is this all. A perfect
jet-work of subterranean chambers was also
iisclosed, some of which were probably used
""or the storage of food, and others as aqueducts
irid cisterns. And the whole result more than ,
;onfirms the ideas of Jewish architectural
grandeur which the books of the Bible and the
jages of Josephus combined to give, but which i
jave hitherto been regarded by many skeptical
liinds as apocryphal.
Along the southern wall his discoveries were :
jcarcely less interesting. Here he found a
loukle pavement, one tweuty-three, the other '
'orty-three feet below the present surface of
the ground. Here also he found some curious

remains both of Hebrew and of Christian origin. :
1'he following description of bis explorations at
:his point, takeu from one of his letters writeu
at the time, will afford the reader a more
graphic picture of the difficulties and dangers
which attended his investigations than can be
$iven by any general description :
"" Ou Friday, having arrived at a depth of!'
leventy-nine feet, the uien were breaking up a :
itoue at the bottom of the shaft. Suddenly the
ground gave way, down went the stone and the
maimer, the men barely saving themselves,
fhey at once rushedjup, and told the sergeant
hey had found the bottomless pit. I went
iown to the spot and examined it; and, in orier
that you may have an idea of the extent of
)ur work, 1 will give you a description of our
lescent.
44 The shaft mouth is on the south side of
.he Sanctuary wall, near the southwest angle,
unong the prickly pears; beside it, to the east,
lying against the Sanctuary wall, is a large
mass of rubbish that has been brought up ;
while over the tuouth itself is a triangular gin,
with iron wheel attached, with guy, for running
ip the excavated soil. Looking down the shaft,
one sees that it is lined for the first twenty feet i
with frames four feet six inches in the clear ; i
further down the Sanctuary wall and soil cut
through are seen, and a man standing at what
ippeurs to be the bottom. An order is given ;
to this man, who repeats it, and then, faintly,
is heard a sepulchral voice answering, as it
were, from another world. Reachiug down to
the man who is visible is a thirty-four feet t opeladder
; and, on descending by it,|one finds he is
itanding ou a ledge which the ladder does not
touch by four feet. This ledge is a top of a
wall running north and south, and abutting on
*he Sanctuary wall ; its east face just cuts the
:cntre of the shaft, which has to be canted off j
sbout two feet toward the east, just where some I
large loose stones jut out in the most disagreeable
manner, liere five more frames have been
Qxed to keep these stones steady. On peering
iown from this ledge one sees the Sanctuary

nun, mm u,o uiujcciiDg courses, unui mey are
lost in the darkness below ; observing also, at
the same time, that two sides of the shaft are
cut through the soil,aand are self-surpporting.
Now to descend this second drop the ladder is
again required; accordingly, having told the
man at the bottom to get under cover, it is
lowered to the Ledge, from whence it is found
that it does not reach to the l>ottom by several
feet. It is therefore lowered to the required
distance, and one has to reach it by climbing
doavn hand over hand for about twelve feet.
On passing along one notes the marvelous joints
of the Sanctuary wail stones, and also, probably,
getsja few blows on skull aud knuckles
from falling pebbles. Just on reaching the
bottom one recdlleots there is still a pit of nakuown
depth to be explored, and cautiouly
straddle across it. Then can be seen that one

coarse in the Sanctuary wall, near the bottom,
is quite smooth all over, the stone l>eing fiuely
dressed, around the drafts ; one also see9 two
stout boards lying against the Sanctuary wall,
under which the men retire whenever an accidental
shower of stones renders their position
dangerous. One is now at a depth of seventynine
feet from the surface, and from here we
coniine ice the exploring of the bottomless
pit.' After dropping a rope down, we found
that it was only six feet deep, though it looked
black enough for any thing.""
Further explorations disclosed a subterruneau
passage, perhaps originally constructed j
to carry off theoverflow from the Temple ; and

narrow that he could barely squeeze through,
and the air so foul as to threaten suffocation.
The difficulty of his position is indicated by the
fact that he had to hack out 200 foet before he
could get to a point where he con'd turn his
head. ? From "" The Recovery"
